# canteen-ng

A web based client for the node-canteen api.

To install the dependencies, use:
```
npm install
```

To compile the TypeScript file, use (of npm install):
```
tsc --removeComments --target ES5 --out ./js/main.js ./main.ts
```

To run the server:
```
npm start
```

Or just clone this repository and serve the files with some http server. Or use gh-pages.

Still WIP.
